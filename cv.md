## About me:
Age: 30 years

I have 7 years of experience working with children with various diseases. A few years ago I got a leg injury, so I canâ€™t physically work for a long time. I would like to learn a new specialty front-end developer. I will try to achieve this goal together with RSS.

I consider ease of learning, the ability to quickly find contact with people, creative thinking and responsibility as my strengths.

  else if (current == 'yellow') return 'red';
  else return 'green';
}
```
